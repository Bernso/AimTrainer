# How to use
All you have to do is just run the setup file. The path to this file would be:
```text
AimTrainer__{latest-version}__Windows/AimTrainer__{latest-version}__Windows__Comiled.exe
```
Once you have opened this file just follow the instructions and you will have the app installed, to open it all you have to do is use the desktop shortcut (if you selected the option) or just press `Windows` then type `AimTrainer` and press `Enter` to open the app.
## If that didn't work
Try installing the .exe file which is located in the `dist` folder.
You can view the code by opening the file:
```text
  ClickTheSpot-UI.py
```
